A simple UI date picker

### Tech
react.js

### Steps
npm install <br />
npm start <br />
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### NOTE:
This is not a production ready code. I haven't implemented linting and haven't concentrated much on the standards as I wanted to get it out.
Also, a prduction ready component will have a min date, max date and disable date options
